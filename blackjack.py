    Rules:
    Try to get as close to 21 without going over.
    Kings, Queens, and Jacks are worth 10 points.
    Aces are worth 1 or 11 points.
    Cards 2 through 10 are worth their face value.
    (H)it to take another card.
    (S)tand to stop taking cards.
    On your first play, you can (D)ouble down to increase your bet
    but must hit exactly one more time before standing.
    In case of a tie, the pot carries over to the next round.
    The dealer stops hitting themselves at 17.''')
